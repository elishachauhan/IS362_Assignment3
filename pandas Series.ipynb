    "### Bicycle Odometer Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "The odometer reading for a bicycle is similar to the odometer on a car. For a car, accumulated miles after each day is automatically showed on the dashboard. In relation to a bicycle, the reading must be done using an application or device that calculates this reading. Utilizing Python and the pandas Series object, an application can be created to calculate how many miles you rode on you bicycle each day. In order to accomplish this task, a programmer must take several steps to store a dictionary of given values and then convert these values to a Series in pandas. In this scenario, you are riding a bicycle from New York City to Key West, Florida over a course of a week. "
